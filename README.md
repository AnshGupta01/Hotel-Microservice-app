An API created with Spring-Boot in which I split up a big project into 6 different services that work in sync with each other. This has been implemented using Eureka Server-Client model. This has been possible due to Spring-Microservice-Architecture

# Project Implementations:
* API gateway
* Eureka server and client
* Spring cloud tools
* Postman
* Feign client
* Spring Security with OKTA (OAuth2.0)
* and a few moreâ€¦.
